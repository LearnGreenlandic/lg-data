<h1>Chapter II-2</h1>
<h2>Sound rules and new words continued</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>As 	repeatedly stated is a deep understanding of the sound rules THE 	very prerogative for acquiring effective Greenlandic. You therefore 	get yet another chapter that will fill you with new information 	almost to the bursting point. Take your time and give the chapter 	what it takes. It is not an easy task but you may look forward to 	the next chapter which will add only little news but rather pick up 	on your present knowledge.</p></li></ul>
<h3>New words</h3>
<p>Learn the new words off by heart. Remember the proper acquisition order from target language to mother tongue - not the other way yet. And remember to speak out the words and endings loud. In this chapter you will give more than normal attention to the new words since the grammar hereunder will draw all your resources. Walk through the words on paper several times and after that you will practice at least an hour or two with automaton II-2.</p>

<h3>About the way derivational morphemes and endings are added to stems</h3>
<p>In the endings in chapter 1 and also here in chapter 2 you met the notation N{±..}. Such instances occur when N's class interact with the material to follow in a rather complicated way.</p>

<p>To understand the process we need to look a little at the nouns'
declinational classes. We have two classes of nouns each with a number of subclasses</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One 	group of nouns willingly loose their final consonants before 	truncating morphemes. We say that these nouns are <b>p-inflected</b> named after the relative case marker in singular N{-p}.</p></li>
<li><p>Another 	group of nouns only unwillingly let go of the final consonant before 	derivational morphemes and endings. We call them <b>up-inflected</b> after their relative case marker in singular N{±up}.</p></li></ol>
<p>Next to the characteristics in the morphemes. In principle we have three types of morphemes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>type 	{- ..}</p></li>
<li><p>type 	{± ..}</p></li>
<li><p>type 	{+ ..}</p></li></ol>
<p>Type {± ..} lets N decide what to do. <i>Qaqortoq</i> is p-inflected and therefore willing to give up its final consonant whereas <i>Ilisimatusarfik</i> is up-inflected and as such tries to retain its final /k/. So when adding for instance {±mi} (local case Sg with no personal endings involved) we therefore get N{-mi} in <i>Qaqortumi</i> but N{+mi} in <i>Ilisimatusarfimmi</i>.</p>

<p>Here you get yet another few examples with N{± mi}:</p>

<p><i>eqqumiitsuliortoq</i> is p-inflected so 'at the artist' will be constructed with {minus mi}
= <i>eqqumiitsuliortumi</i></p>

<p><i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfik</i> is up-inflected so 'at the gymnasium' takes {plus mi} =
<i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfimmi</i></p>

<p><i>Kangerlussuaq</i> is up-inflected so 'in Kangerlussuaq' with {plus mi} =
<i>Kangerlussuarmi</i></p>

<p><i>ulloq</i> is p-inflected so 'today' takes {minus mi} = <i>ullumi</i></p>

<p><i>tutsiuteqqittarneq</i> is up-inflected so 'during the repeated let-hear-from' we need {plus ni} = <i>tutsiuteqqittarnerni</i></p>

<p><i>nukappiaraannaq</i> (/nukappiaraq-INNAQ/) is up-inflected so 'only with the boys' takes {plus ni} =
<i>nukappiaraannarni</i></p>

<p><i>arnaq</i> is p-inflected so 'at the women' takes {minus ni} = <i>arnani</i></p>

<h3>Where to use the contemporative mood</h3>
<p>I hope that you remember this piece of information from last chapter</p>

<p><i><b>The participle</b></i><i></i> <i>is the verb form we among other things use to make subordinate clauses in 'that' but only when the subject in the main clause is different from the subject for the participle.</i></p>

<p>In today's text you saw a few examples of the opposite case namely when the main clause and the subordinate clause share the same subject. In such cases participle must not be used. Instead one uses the contemporative in the subordinate clause and all other instances of secondary verbal activities performed by the same subject. In today's text we saw</p>

<p><i>Per.. nuuppoq .. (Per) najugaqarsimalluni ..</i></p>

<p>'Per moved' is the main clause/ the primary message and 'Per has lived' is further information about the same subject. It is therefore not idiomatic to use indicative in <i>najugaqarsimavoq.</i> The comtemporary works smoother <i>najugaqarsimalluni.</i></p>

<p>The other example was</p>

<p><i>(Per)
qarasaasiaq atorlugu (Per) oqaasilerivoq ..</i></p>

<p><i>'Per</i> works as a linguist' is the primary piece of information but another piece of information is added namely that the same <i>Per</i> uses a computer for the purpose. Since this is the secondary piece of information it should be put in the contemporative.</p>

<p>You will hear the contemporative mood in almost every sentence you hear in real communication so you must learn how to perceive it already in this early phase of your learning.</p>

<p>The contemporative is namely not only used to express English subordinate clauses as in 'I am sure that I told you' (where you in Greenlandic will 'be sure' in the indicative mood and 'tell' in the contemporative mood). The contemporative also very frequently expresses what in English would have been adverbs as in 'it was pleasantly warm' which in Greenlandic would be 'it was was warm (indicative mood) being pleasant (contemporative mood). Finally, contemporative mood often breaks up complex semantics into several statements as in the language technology example .</p>

<p>The contemporative mood is as mentioned above extremely frequently used so it is mandatory for you to learn to perceive it. But it will most likely take some time before you are able to produce it yourself fast enough for practical communication. Fortunately, it is rather easy to work around it by putting an extra full stop and breaking down a complex statement into several main clauses as in the example above where you perfectly well could have expressed the same meaning in two separate sentences</p>

<p><i>Per ..</i> <i>nuuppoq. Ukiorpassuarni Kalaallit Nunaanni najugaqarsimavoq</i></p>

<h3>A detail with some additive morphemes</h3>
<p>Normally +MORPHEME means simple addition to the stem before - of course with due respect to the general sound rules. They work without exception whenever parts of language are glued together.</p>

<p>There are, though, a few morphemes that insist on a double consonant before them. N+PAK - therefore also N+PAK=SUAQ - and N+SUAQ have such behaviour.</p>

<p>Whenever the morphemes are added to a consonant this comes by itself but with a vowel before there is nothing to build the double consonant. Therefore an /r/ is added between stem and morpheme:</p>

<p><i>ukioq</i>+PAK=SUAQ+ni ⟹ <i>ukiorpassuarni</i> ('for many years')</p>

<p><i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfik</i>+PAK=SUAQ+ni ⟹ <i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfippassuarni</i> ('in</p>

<p>	many grammar schools')</p>

<p><i>anaana</i>+r+PAK=SUAQ+ni ⟹ <i>anaanarpassuarni</i> ('in many mothers')</p>

<p>Here are a few examples with N+SUAQ:</p>

<p><i>akisooq</i>+SUAQ ⟹
<i>akisoorsuaq</i> ('sth very expensive')</p>

<p><i>ilisimatusarfik</i>+SUAQ ⟹
<i>ilisimatusarfissuaq</i> ('a big university')</p>

<p><i>illu</i>+r+SUAQ ⟹
<i>illorsuaq</i> ('a big house')</p>

<h3>The shape of contemporative mood</h3>
<p>One speciality with the contemporative mood may be a bit surprising in the beginning but is actually logical and easy to understand.</p>

<p>The subject for a contemporative is always given as it normally only can be the subject of the main clause. It is thus superfluous to repeat that piece of information.</p>

<p>That is exactly what Greenlandic exploits with the transitive contemporative mood. The subject is simply left out of the ending leaving only information about the object. We thus get:</p>

<p><i>atorsimallugu</i> means 'that <b>I</b> have used it'
in a sentence as <i>oqarpunga qarasaasiaq atorsimallugu</i></p>

<p><i>atorsimallugu</i> means 'that <b>you</b> have used it' in a sentence as <i>oqarpit qarasaasiaq atorsimallugu?</i></p>

<p><i>atorsimallugu</i> means 'that <b>he</b> has used it' in a sentence as <i>oqarpoq qarasaasiaq atorsimallugu</i></p>

<p><i>atorsimallugu</i> means 'that <b>we</b> have used it' in the sentence <i>oqarpugut qarasaasiaq atorsimallugu</i></p>

<p>We will not yet try to cover the contemporative in details but only lift this corner of the veil. If you personally are happy with whole paradigms and connected systems you should consult a grammar book. Almost all grammar books on Greenlandic include lots of whole paradigms.</p>

<h3>The genitive and the complicated 'part-of' construction</h3>
<p>Genitive is the form of the noun to be used whenever the noun is "the owner" of something: 'my father's clock', 'she is every boy's dream', 'the book's cover' are all examples of genitive. My father owns the clock, the boys "own" the dream, and the book own the cover. We call the grammatical owner possessor.</p>

<p>The clock, the dream, and the cover are owned by the possessors. Grammatically such words are termed possessum.</p>

<p>In most languages in the world only the possessor is grammatically marked (it is the /s/ that tells us who the possessor is) but in Greenlandic both the possessor and possessum are marked with grammatical endings.</p>

<p>The possessor is in the relative case whereas the possessum is in whatever case any other noun in the same position in the sentence would be in.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>'Per's 	student is called Tika' ⟹ <i>Per</i> is possessor so he will be relative case whereas <i>student</i> is subject for an intransitive verb. She will get an ending telling 	that she is possessum but will be put in the absolutive case like 	all other subjects for intransitive verbs.</p></li>
<li><p>'Per's 	student recorded the material' ⟹ <i>Per</i> is 	still possessor and will accordingly be in the relative case but in 	this sentence also <i>student</i> must 	be put in the relative case since <i>student</i> now is subject for a transitive verb. But she will be 	supplied with an ending telling us that she is possessum.</p></li>
<li><p>'Per's 	student's father is called Kunngi' ⟹ <i>Per</i> is possessor. He 	is relative case as is <i>student</i> since she, too, is possessor. <i>father,</i> though, 	is absolutive since he is subject for the intransitive verb 	<i>ateqarpoq</i>. Still, both <i>student</i> and <i>father</i> will get 	endings telling us that they are possessum</p></li>
<li><p>'They 	took classes with Per's student' ⟹ <i>student</i> is local case 	but supplied with an ending telling us that she is possessum.</p></li></ul>
<p>We will not yet deal with relative case in details but in today's text we saw two possessor-possessum phrases. We will address those now:</p>

<p><i>Kalaallit Nunaat</i> means 'Greenland'. It consists of possessor <i>kalaaleq</i> in the plural and in relative case. Possessor is always relative case. Furthermore, the construction contains the word <i>nuna</i> and the ending N{±at} being possessum. Ending tells us that possessor is 3. person plural ('their') and that possessum is singular (only one country).</p>

<p><i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfiit ilaanni</i> means 'in one of the grammar schools'. It consists of possessor <i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfik</i> being plural and relative case as possessor always is followed by possessum (=the owned one) <i>ila. ila</i> is the element expressing 'one out of N'. In itself the word <i>ila</i> means 'en fælle' but phrases like 'their one <i>ila</i>' /ila-at/ <i>ilaat</i> is equivalent to English 'one of them' as 'their <i>ila</i> plural' /ila-it/ <i>ilaat</i> would mean 'some of them'.</p>

<p>In this example <i>ila</i> has the ending N{±at} (= their one N) and the locative ending N{±ni}. Element for element <i>Ilinniarnertuunngorniarfiit ilaanni</i> accordingly means 'in the grammar schools' one <i>ila</i>' or to put it more idiomatically 'in one of the grammar schools'.</p>

<p>If you right now feel that Greenlandic works in a cumbersome way you maybe should try to remember your own problems with the partitive genitive in latin back in school or give a thought to foreigners'
problems with the many ways to express this 'part-of-something idea'
in English (how exactly will I know when to say <i>part of</i> vs. <i>share of</i> vs. <i>one of</i> vs. <i>piece of</i> etc. etc.)</p>

<p>The fact is that it is correct that it is complicated in Greenlandic but so it is in almost all other languages as well.</p>

<h3>Some more theory</h3>
<p>Already in module I you saw the crucial rule that one in principle always needs to build words on the base of a wordform without endings. If you stretch your understanding just a bit you actually recognize the logic also from English. A 'stamp collector' most unlikely has collected only one stamp as the word says in isolation. And a 'womanizer' most likely has had a go on more than one woman. Still we do not speak of a *stamps collector or a *womenizer. We understand the plural somehow else.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of singular bases for word building is thus not entirely unknown to an English speaker but the scale is admittedly quite a bit larger in Greenlandic than in English.</p>

<p>In today's text we had the word <i>ukiorpassuarnilu.</i> The derivational morpheme N+PAK=SUAQ of course never occurs in the singular. It has to be plural as in <i>kalaalerpassuit</i> (many Greenlanders), <i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfippassuit</i> (lots of grammar schools) and <i>illorpassuit</i> (lots of houses).</p>

<p>The examples above all have a grammatical ending for plural. Accordingly, we cannot add further endings or derivational morphemes to the words since we only kan build on on the basis of a singular wordform. So to add endings like N{± ni} or N{± nut} we must construct a base form.</p>

<p>Even though we cannot say *<i>kalaalerpassuaq</i>, only <i>kalaalerpassuit</i>, we still need to base 'at many Greenlanders' upon <i>kalaaleq +</i>PASSUAQ+ni =
<i>kalaalerpassuarni</i> and 'to many grammar schools'
likewise on <i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfik+</i>PASSUAQ+nut =
<i>ilinniarnertuunngorniarfippassuarnut.</i></p>

<p>It was the same phenomenon we had in <i>arfineq-pingasuinnarnik ukioqarpoq.</i> N{±nik} cannot be added to a word with plural endings so we need to go via the singular <i>arfineq-pingasoq</i>-INNAQ+nik to make it to the right word for 'only 8 years'
<i>arfineq-pingasuinnarnik ukioqarpoq</i>.</p>

<h3>A speciality</h3>
<p>You know the derivational morpheme N+SUAQ from words such as <i>Kangerlussuaq</i> (<i>kangerluk</i>+SUAQ). It takes part in today's lesson in the chain of morphemes N+PAK=SUAQ. It is a little complicated but since it is widely used you need to have a somehow good understanding of it already now. Try to accept only a half-spoken truth in this phase of your learning, namely that the morpheme basically has two different shapes without actively trying to learn when it puts on which of its forms.</p>

<p>In certain contexts N+SUAQ is SUK and in other it is SUAQ. We say</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"there 	is a big university" <i>ilisimatusarfik</i>+SUAQ-QAR{+vuq}
<i>ilisimatusarfis</i><i>suaqarpoq</i></p></li>
<li><p>"this 	is a big university" <i>ilisimatusarfik</i>+SUK-U{+vuq}
<i>ilisimatusarfis</i><i>suuvoq</i>.</p></li></ul>
