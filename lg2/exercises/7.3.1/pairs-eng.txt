03	ikinngutiga kalaaleq nuliaqarpoq	ikinngutima kalaallip nulia	You have already seen the special -aq in the derivational morphemes N-NNGUAQ, N+SUAQ and Vb+GALUAQ. -aq sometimes disappears and leaves us with the alternative stems of N-NNGUK, N+SUK and Vb+GALUK. The alternatives will be used with endings in vowel like relative case {-up}, plural {-it} and possessum like {-a}. There are a few stems with the same behaviour. nuliaq is such one. That is why 'his wife' NOT is (nuliaq-a) -> *nuliaa but rather nuli<s>aq</s>-a -> nulia.
