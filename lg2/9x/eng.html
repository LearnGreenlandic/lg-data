<p>Take good care to keep track of the persons in today's exercises especially the ones with both subjects and objects. If you are not absolutely sure about who does what to whom in the sentences you must press ☼ and start deciphering by making sure about marks for subject and object in the verb. The subject-tag is immediately to right of +V and the object-tag is the one with a capital O.</p>

<p>May I suggest that you re-read the paragraph "Extremely important again" in the introduction to II-8X?</p>

<p>The exercises hereunder bring no news. All sentences are nothing but consolidation of known stuff. First you get a simpel perception exercise 9.1X for you to revisit a number of inflectional endings from the transitive indicative.</p>

<p>After that things get a bit more complicated in the long 9.2X that is intended to help you get the constant shift in subordinate clauses between non-coreferential sentences with the participle and the coreferential counterparts with contemporative under your skin. In 9.2X all verbs in the subordinate clauses are intransitive but note that contemporative can be both positive as in .. Nuummukarluni/going to Nuuk .. and in .. Nuummukarnani/not going to Nuuk ..</p>

<p>Finally we will step up problems a bit further in 9.3X. The exercise is still about the shift between non-coreferential sentences and coreferential ones but i this exercise we introduce transitive verbs in the subordinate clauses.</p>

<p>Finally 9.4X randomize the thousands of sentences from 9.2X and 9.3X</p>

<p>I suggest that you invest quite a bit of energy on the oratio obliqua exercises since oratio obliqua is a phenomenon you cannot avoid in the real world outside the classroom. During normal communication you will run into the participle/contemporative dichotomy almost immediately. Furthermore, the exercises give you many examples of two inflectional sets we this far touched very sketchily upon, namely negated contemporative and participle with object.</p>
