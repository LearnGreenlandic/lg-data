<h1>Chapter II-5</h1>
<h2>New derivational morphemes, more examples with participle vs. contemporative, and your first meeting with the causative mood</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Today's 	to-do-list contains first and foremost rather many new derivational 	morphemes. We will also try to mix our knowledge about participle 	from chapter 1 with knowledge about contemporative from chapter 2. 	The two moods are namely each other's complement. Finally, we will 	touch upon a few endings from the causative mood. Causative is the 	form of the verb used for expressing time clauses and causal clauses</p></li></ul>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>In English you handle comparison by means of adjectives and adverbs ('good', 'better', 'best', etc.). In Greenlandic adjectives do not form a part of speech at all and adverbs work rather differently from English adverbs. Instead comparison is an issue for the verbs apart from a few cases where certain nouns have some kind of innate semantics that is in itself comparative as in the example in today's text " .. <i>uannit .. angajullernik"</i> ('than me .. an older one').</p>

<p>The by far most common way to make comparison is by means of the derivational morpheme Vb+NIRU.</p>

<p><i>atorpoq - atorneruvoq</i> 'it is in use - it is more in use'</p>

<p><i>imaappoq - imaanneruvoq</i> 'it is so - it is more like so'</p>

<p><i>nalunarpoq - nalunarneruvoq</i> 'it is hard - it is harder'</p>

<p>The something or somebody one compares to is normally preceded by 'than'
in English ('She is older <u>than</u>
me'). In Greenlandic the ablative case serves this purpose. Ablative's basic meaning is otherwise 'direction away from/ out of N'. The ablative of <i>uanga</i> is <i>uannit. uannit</i> accordingly means 'from me' as well as 'than me' depending on context.</p>

<h3>Tricky ә again</h3>
<p>You know already that /ә/ turns /i/
in both writing and pronunciation when followed by a consonant as in /aŋutәt/ ⟹ <i>angutit</i> and that it turns /a/
when followed by a vowel as in /aŋutәuvuq/
⟹ <i>angutaavoq.</i></p>

<p>But /ә/ causes many more problems elsewhere. For instance in one of the contemporative mood wordforms found in today's text. Contemporative has a rather straightforward structure with {llu} after vowels as in <i>paasillugu</i> and <i>ilinniaqqullugu</i> ('understanding it' and 'making her study') and {lu} after consonants as in <i>atorlugu</i> and <i>ilinniartillugu</i> ('using it' and 'teaching him'). But after the vowel /ә/ it is more complicated than that. Following our present state of knowledge the centemporative of a stem like <i>aqqutigi-</i> (*aqqutigә) 'has it as one's way' ought to be *aqqutigillugu<sup><a><sup>2</sup></a></sup>. But the correct wordform is <i>aqqutigalugu</i>. We will not here clarify the historical developments that shaped this deviant wordform only realize the fact that contemporative does not take {llu} but {lu} after /ә/ and that /ә/ in exactly this position becomes <i>-a-</i> instead of the /i/ we expected.</p>

<h3>The causative mood</h3>
<p>Causative is sometimes called 'when/because mood' because it is the mood to be used when we need to express time relations and causal relations.</p>

<p>In today's text there are 7 instances of causative:</p>

<p><i>11. klasse</i> <i><u>naammassigakku</u></i> <i>GU-mi aallartippunga</i> '<u>When I finished</u> 11. class I started at GU (the Greenlandic grammar school)'.</p>

<p><i><u>Ukeereerama</u></i> <i>atuaqqilerpunga</i> '<u>When I had overwintered</u> I began to study again'.</p>

<p><i>GU</i> <i><u>naammassigakku</u></i> <i>ilinniartitsisooqqaarpunga.</i> '<u>When I finished</u> GU I first worked as a school teacher.</p>

<p><i>..</i> <i><u>ilinnialerama</u></i> <i>paasivara ..</i> '<u>When I started to study</u> .. I realized ..'</p>

<p><i>Taamak</i> <i><u>oqarfigimmanga</u></i> <i>uniinnarpunga</i> ' <u>Because she said</u> so <u>to me</u> I simply quit.</p>

<p><i><u>Sulileqquneqarama</u></i> <i>sulilerpunga.</i> '<u>When I was asked to start working</u> I began to work.'</p>

<p><i>Oqaasilerineq</i> <i><u>soqutigigakku</u></i> <i>aallartippunga.</i> '<u>Because I am interested in</u> linguistics I started'</p>

<h3>A few words about passive</h3>
<p>Passive is used in English and Greenlandic alike to change focus in a statement from the actor to the target of the action. Put another way, focus moves from the subject to the object. Accordingly, passive is only an issue in connection with transitive verbs. <i>Peter saw me</i> is active. The main message is that Peter does smt. The passive equivalent is <i>I was seen by Peter</i> with a primary message about me.</p>

<p>Passive is also widely used in formal language as road signs and law texts (<i>Smoking is prohibited!</i> and <i>The case will be dealt with in a higher court.</i>)</p>

<p>Typically, passive is formed in Greenlandic with the derivational morpheme Vb+NIQAR and the original subject put into the ablative case. <i>Uanga taanna atorpara</i> <i>- Taanna uannit atorneqarpoq</i> 'I used it - It was used by me'.</p>

<h3>A speciality</h3>
<p>You have this far seen causative's transitive endings in shapes like Vb{+gakku} and Vb{+(m)maŋa}. You accordingly have three pieces of information included in the ending: </p>

<p>1. The mood is causative which means 'because Vb' or 'when Vb'</p>

<p>2. Who is the subject? {gakku}'s subject is 'I' and {(m)maŋa}'s subject is 'he'</p>

<p>3. Who is the object? {gakku}'s object is 'him' and {(m)maŋa}'s object is 'me'</p>

<p>One could have gone another step deeper and learned that causative is built by the modal marker {ga} or {(m)m} followed by any one of the possible 60 combinations of personal endings.</p>

<p>The profit of this rather theoretical approach is that once one starts to include also the conditional mood the only new thing one needs to learn is that conditional's modal marker is {gu} followed by the same<a><sup>3</sup></a>
personal endings as we know from the causative mood. 'Once I am done with it' is <i>naammassigukku</i> (cf. <i>naammassigakku</i> mearning 'because I am done with it').</p>

<p>Basically, the choice is yours. You can learn two times 60 ready-to-use endings or you can choose to learn 60 endings plus two modal markers that you will be able to fit together on the fly.</p>

<p>But for the moment you need to know the modal marker {ga} because it has a little deviant form after Vb-NNGIT. Traditionally, {ga} used a variety in the shape of {na} immediately after negations. 'Because I did not use it' (<i>ator</i>-NNGIT+gakku)
accordingly is NOT <i>*atunngikkakku</i> as expected but <i>atunnginnakku.</i> Observe that this behaviour is absolutely specific for causative's {ga}. It does not apply anywhere else. It is as expected (<i>ator</i>-NNGIT+maŋa)
<i>atunngimmanga</i> (because he did not use me) and <i>atunngikkukku</i> (if I do not use it).</p>

<p>But again, do not invest too much energy in this detail. As with most other exception rules in modern Greenlandic this one too is on its heels. One hears the regular wordforms in young language all the time so make sure to tell yourself over and over again that an <i>atunngikkakku</i> that makes it out of your mouth under all circumstances is a hundred times better than an <i>atunnginnakku</i> that stays in your head!</p>

<h3>Another speciality</h3>
<p>In chapter 3 you saw that the 3.Sg participle ('that he') takes the ending Vb{+Tuq} where {T..} tells us that the first consonant in the ending is variable. The rule is that T ⟹ /s/ when added to vowel, but becomes /t/ when added to a consonant.</p>

<p>This rule is consequent and without exceptions so this is again absolutely a trifle you must not worry too much about.</p>

<p>After the socalled privative morpheme Vb-IT (like English un- in 'unseen' and 'undone') and the negation Vb-NNGIT a minor process in central West Greenlandic (not in the South and the North) causes the second /t/ to be pronounced with a slight aspiration. Unfortunately, this aspiration is reflected in orthography giving rise to an extra problem in the L2 class room.</p>

<p>This is the reason why we write the city name as <i>Maniitsoq</i>. But take care: The proper pronunciation is NOT *[ma niit soq] rather [ma niit t<sup>s</sup>oq]. The C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>
rule certainly works, so we have two /t/-s just that the latter is closed by a little s-sound.</p>

<p>Therefore you still have only one rule to learn by heart about T, namely that T turns /t/after a consonant. Then you may safely form words straight forwardly as <i>ajor</i>-NNGIT+Tuq ⇒ *<i>ajunngittoq.</i> You will under all circumstances be understood in spite of the little "sin" that standard orthography wants you to write <i>ajunngitsoq.</i></p>

<h3><b>And finally a speciality</b></h3>
<p>Did you wonder why 'my big sister' in Tika's story is <i>angajora</i> and not <i>angajuga</i> as one would expect with the stem being <i>angaju</i>?</p>

<p>It is so that p-stems in vowels tend to have an alternative form with a final <i>-q</i> that varies rather freely with the "normal" form according to dialect and/ or individual style. Almost all endings with p-stems are truncating which means that we cannot tell whether <i>angajup</i> or <i>angajumut</i> are formed on the basis of <i>angaju</i> ({aŋaju-p} and {aŋaju-mut}) or on the basis of <i>angajoq</i> ({aŋajuq-p} and {aŋajuq-mut}). It is only with the ending N{+ga}
there is a difference.</p>

<p>The answer, thus, is that you may safely use both forms. </p>

<div><p><a>1</a>In 	this chapter this ending is only used in the exercises</p></div>
<div><p><a>2</a>which 	as a matter of facts is often heard in young language and child 	language.</p></div>
<div><p><a>3</a>There 	is a little bit of variation, but too little to really contradict 	the uniformity.</p></div>
