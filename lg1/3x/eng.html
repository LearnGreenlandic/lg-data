<h2>News and objectives in chapter 1-3X</h2>
<p>4 verbal stems (henceforward <b><a class="tip">V</a></b>) and 4 inflectional endings. Together they will produce 8 verbs and hundreds of sentences when combined with the rest of today's lesson and what you learned in chapter 2.</p>

<p>You will </p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>continue training the skill you cannot be without namely the two-sided ability to perceive surface words and at the same time to produce words out of abstract bits and pieces underlying the surface words you hear</li>
	<li>understand the wordforms you know by now in spite of the fact that they might sound differently because of altered context</li>
	<li>form a few simple sentences</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Four verbal stems</b></p>
<p>Note that verbal stems are ungrammatical without proper inflectional endings</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>aallar</i>{}</span> <span class="col">to leave, to depart</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>ilinniartip</i>{}</span> <span class="col">to teach (object)</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>naapip</i>{}</span> <span class="col">to meet (object)</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>tikip</i>{}</span> <span class="col">to come, to arrive</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>One personal pronoun</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>ilissi</i> = you (plural)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Noun endings</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><a class="tip">Lok</a> = {mi} or {ni} (case lokalis "in/on-case". mi-variety after uninflected words and ni-variety after words already inflected</li>
	<li><a class="tip">Abs</a>: Absolutive case is the basic shape of the noun. So once you acquired nouns like <i>Qaqortoq</i> or <i>pizza</i> you also learned that they are in the absolutive case (and normally in the singular). Do not waste too much energy on Abs at the moment but make sure not to get confused when Abs is mentioned for the first time (in exercise 1-3.11X)</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Four inflectional endings</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>(<a class="tip">Ind</a> <a class="tip">1Sg</a>) = {punga} <a class="link-info" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-content="The verbal ending in indicative is in priciple {vu+subject's person} and {va+subject's person+object's person}.

</ul>

<h2>What you need to know about processes and changes (phonology)</h2>

<h3>Adding to your knowledge</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Nominal stems apart from loanwords can only end in a vowel or /k/ or /p/ or /q/ or /t/. In order to adapt loanwords ending in consonants others than the mentioned to take the bits and pieces needed (inflectional endings and derivational morphemes) an /i/ is added to Danish loanwords before further word formation. Hence <i>Rosing</i>+Abl (= <i>from Rosing</i>) will be <i>Rosingimit.</i> Loanwords from English can be adapted the same way but are often formed with a hyphen instead like <i>Royal Greenland</i>+Trm (= <i>to Royal Greenland</i>) will be <i>Royal Greenland-imut</i>.</li>
	<li>The verbal endings are not entirely freely applicable. The two endings that mark the object can only be combined with stems that reasonably can be used with objects like <i>to teach <b>him</b></i> and <i>to meet <b>him</b></i>. We call such stems transitive verbs. Vice versa stems like <i>depart</i> and <i>arrive</i> come with no object. We call such verbal stems intransitive verbs. That is why our 4 stems + 4 endings do <b>not</b> form 16 wordforms only 8.</li>
	<li>Note that /e/ does not turn /i/ and /o/ not /u/ in proper nouns like <i>Egede</i> vs. <i>Egedemut</i>. This is a purely orthographical standard only applicable to proper nouns. Everywhere else /e/ and /o/ will turn /i/ and /u/ unless followed by /q/ or /r/.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brushing up chapter 2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>p-stem nouns (marked with -) drop the final consonant before most endings whereas up-stem nouns retain their final consonants before most endings. *<i>Aputsiaq</i>-mut ➔ <i>Aputsiamut</i> whereas<i> *Malik+mut</i> ➔ *<i>Malikmut</i> ➔ <i>Malimmut</i></li>
	<li>/u/ is spelled -o- before /q/ and /r/ and there cannot be an -o- if not followed by /q/ or /r/. <i>Qaqortoq</i> but <i>Qaqortoq</i>-mut ➔ <i>Qaqortumut</i></li>
	<li>Whenever two consonants meet the first one assimilates to the second one. This process though, is only partial with /q/ before any consonant but /q/: <i>Aasiak</i>+nut ➔ Aasiannut, but <i>Qeqertarsuaq</i>+mut ➔ <i>Qeqertarsuarmut</i></li>
	<li>Use the m-varieties of case terminalis (Trm) and ablative (Abl) with baseforms and the n-varieties after wordforms inflected for number and possessor's person and number: <i>Nukamut</i> but <i>Sisimiunut</i> and <i>Nunatta Atuagaateqarfianut</i></li>
</ul>
