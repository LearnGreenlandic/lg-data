<h2>Today's news and objectives</h2>
<p>Learn how to ask a few questions using the interrogative mood (henceforward Int). By the end of today's exercises you will be able to handle more than 1,000 wordforms.</p>

<p>You will observe that today's exercises introduce only a few new items but you will most likely also observe that playing with the new derivational morphemes forces you to have a lot on your plate. But do not worry! I know from personal experience that it is doable after all.</p>

<p><b>Play with another derivational morpheme added to nouns. You know it already from lesson 5</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">N-U</span> <span class="col">to be N</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Play with a new important derivational morpheme added to verbs</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">Vb-<b>NNGIT</b></span> <span class="col">to not Vb</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>The first things about asking questions</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>V+Int+2Sg = {vit} <a class="link-info" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-content="Remember that /v/ turns /p/ after consonant. Hence suli+{vit} → &lt;i&gt;sulivit&lt;/i&gt;, whereas aallar+{vit} → &lt;i&gt;aallarpit&lt;/i&gt;"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i></a> (interrogative mood 2. person singular = <i>You verb?</i>)</li>
	<li>V+Int+2Sg+3SgO = {viuk} (interrogative mood 2. person singular with 3. person singular object = <i>You verb him/her/it?</i>)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Clarifying a thing about mood-morphemes:</b></p>
<p>Greenlandic does not have a stock of conjunctions such as <i>because, if, that</i> etc. Instead a mandatory part of the verb called the mood-morpheme tells the verb's function.</p>

<p>This far you've seen only two indicative morphemes</p>
<ul>
	<li>{+vu} (varying with {+pu} after consonants) is intransitive indicative as in tikip{+vunga} → <i>tikippunga</i> (I arrive)</li>
	<li>{+va} (varying with {+pa} after consonants) is transitive indicative as in naapip{+vara} → <i>naapippara</i> (I met him/her)</li>
</ul>

<p>but today a new mood morpheme is introduced</p>
<ul>
	<li>{+vi} (varying with {+pi} after consonants) is interrogative mood for second person intransitive and transitive alike</li>
</ul>

<p>Vb-NNGIT has a unique behaviour in the indicative mood as it replaces both {+vu} and {+va} with {-la}.</p>
<p>E.g. I am bad (ajor {+vunga}) = <i>ajorpunga</i>; I am not bad/ I am good (ajor -NNGIT {-langa}) = <i>ajunngilanga</i></p>

<p>You will as in the preceding chapters</p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>continue training the skill you cannot be without namely the two-sided ability to perceive surface words and at the same time to produce words out of abstract bits and pieces underlying the surface words you hear</li>
	<li>understand the wordforms you know by now in context</li>
	<li>form a few simple sentences</li>
</ol>

<h2>What you need to know about processes and changes (phonology)</h2>
<h3>Adding to your knowledge</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Any vowel adjacent to an /a/ will itself become /a/. Hence <i>pizza-U+vuq (It is pizza)</i> will be <i>pizzaavoq</i></li>
	<li>Greenlandic orthography holds a few superfluous rules. One such says that <i>*uvi</i>, <i>*uve</i> and <i>*uva</i> (but not <i>uvu</i> and <i>uvo</i>!) must be spelled without /v/ as <i>ui</i>, <i>ue</i> and <i>ua.</i> Accordingly e.g. taku{+vara} (I saw him/her/it) is misspelled as *takuvara and correct as <i>takuara</i>. The rule is purely orthographical. *takuvara and <i>takuara</i> both share the same pronunciation.</li>
	<li>GUSUP comes with a speciality as it changes /g/ to /r/ after vowel. Hence taku + GUSUP + I_him will NOT be *takugusuppara, rather <i>takorusuppara</i> (I want to see him/her/it) and suli + GUSUP + I will NOT be *suligusuppunga but <i>sulerusuppunga</i> (I want to work). Note that this behaviour is special for GUSUP so do not bring it with you to other morphemes in /g/</li>
	<li>{vu} normally reduces to {a} after -SSA. Hence suli -SSA {+vunga} (work future I) will not be *<i>sulissavunga</i> as expected but <i>sulissaanga</i>. Please observe that this phenomenon only occurs with SSA + {vu}. Accordingly <i>naapip -SSA</i> {+vara} (meet future I_him) will be <i>naapissavara</i> as expected. As a matter of facts the rule applies with only about 4% of all occurrences of -SSA in running text so do not overdo this exception. If in doubt it is better to underdo it. *<i>sulissavunga</i> will maybe call for a smile but it will always be understood whereas <i>*naapissaara</i> most likely will be gibberish in native ears.</li>
</ul>
