<h2>News and objectives in chapter 1-4X</h2>
<p>Say hello to a few common nouns (henceforward <b><a class="tip">N</a></b>) and to your first derivational morphemes. By the end of today's exercises you will be able to handle thousands of wordforms.</p>

<p>You will observe that today's exercises introduce only a few new items but you will most likely also observe that playing with the new derivational morphemes forces you to have a lot on your plate. But do not worry! I know from personal experience that it is doable after all.</p>

<p><b>Play with a few derivational morphemes added to nouns</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">N-<b>QAR</b></span> <span class="col">to have N <lg-fn>4a</lg-fn>/ there is N</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">N+<b>TUR</b></span> <span class="col">to eat/drink N <lg-fn>4b</lg-fn></span></span></li>
</ul>

<lg-fn-def n="4a">A number of semantic restrictions apply as to what kind of N one can have/own. For instance will pisiniarfik-QAR <b>not</b> mean "*he has a shop" without an extra morpheme -UTE as in <i>pisiniarfiuteqarpoq</i>. Still, it is well-formed with an impersonal subject <i>pisiniarfeqarpoq</i> (<i>There is a shop</i>)</lg-fn-def>
<lg-fn-def n="4b">Where N must be drinkable or edible. <i>whiskytorpunga</i> and <i>pizzatorpoq</i> are well-formed verbs whereas *pisiniarfittorpunga is nonsense.</lg-fn-def>

<p><b>Play with a few derivational morphemes added to verbs</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">V+<b>GUSUP</b></span> <span class="col">to want to Vb</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>You will</p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>continue training the skill you cannot be without namely the two-sided ability to perceive surface words and at the same time to produce words out of abstract bits and pieces underlying the surface words you hear</li>
	<li>understand the wordforms you know by now in context</li>
	<li>form a few simple sentences</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lexical material you need to know to manage today's exercises</h3>
<p><b>N</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>ateq</i>+</span> <span class="col">a name</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>pisiniarfik</i>+</span> <span class="col">a shop</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>pizza</i></span> <span class="col">pizza</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>tii</i></span> <span class="col">tea</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3"><i>whisky</i></span> <span class="col">whisky</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h2>What you need to know about processes and changes (phonology)</h2>
<h3>Adding to your knowledge</h3>
<ul>
	<li>/g/ fuses with preceding /q/ or /r/ and becomes /r/. Hence <i>aallar</i>+GUSUP → <i>aallarusup</i> (to want to depart)</li>
	<li>/g/ becomes /k/ if preceded by a consonant other than /q/ or /r/. Hence <i>tikip</i>+GUSUP → tikipkusup → <i>tikikkusup</i> <lg-fn>4c</lg-fn></li>
</ul>

<lg-fn-def n="4c">Remember that whenever two consonants meet the first one assimilates to the second one.</lg-fn-def>
