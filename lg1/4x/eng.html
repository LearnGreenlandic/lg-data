<h2>Today's news and objectives</h2>
<p>Say hello to a few common nouns (henceforward <b><a href="#" class="tip">N</a></b>), to your first derivational morphemes and learn how to ask a few questions using the interrogative mood (henceforward <b>Int</b>). By the end of today's exercises you will be able to handle more than nnn wordforms.</p>

<p>You will observe that today's exercises introduce only a few new items but you will most likely also observe that playing with the new derivational morphemes forces you to have a lot on your plate. But do not worry! I know from personal experience that it is doable after all.</p>

<p><b>Play with a few derivational morphemes added to nouns</b></p>

For instance will pisiniarfik-QAR &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; mean &quot;*he has a shop&quot; without an extra morpheme -UTE as in &lt;i&gt;pisiniarfiuteqarpoq&lt;/i&gt;. Still, it is well-formed with an impersonal subject (&lt;i&gt;There is a shop)&lt;/i&gt;"><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i></a>/ there is N</span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li><span class="row"><span class="col col-3">V+<b>GUSUP</b></span> <span class="col">to want to Vb</span></span></li>

<p>You will</p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>continue training the skill you cannot be without namely the two-sided ability to perceive surface words and at the same time to produce words out of abstract bits and pieces underlying the surface words you hear</li>
	<li>understand the wordforms you know by now in context</li>
	<li>form a few simple sentences</li>
</ol>

<h2>What you need to know about processes and changes (phonology)</h2>
<h3>Adding to your knowledge</h3>
<ul>
	<li>/g/ fuses with preceding /q/ or /r/ and becomes /r/. Hence <i>aallar</i>+GUSUP → <i>aallarusup</i> (to want to depart)</li>
	<li>/g/ becomes /k/ if preceded by a consonant other than /q/ or /r/. Hence <i>tikip</i>+GUSUP → tikipkusup → <i>tikikkusup</i> <a class="link-info" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-content="Remember that whenever two consonants meet the first one assimilates to the second one."><i class="bi bi-info-square"></i></a></li>
