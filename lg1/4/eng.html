<h1><b>Lesson 4.</b></h1>
<h2><b>We are almost home! Start using your new skills</b></h2>
<p>If you worked through all the exercises in the preceding chapters you will by now be in a situation where no Greenlandic word is beyond your pronunciation capacity. We have covered everything.</p>

<p>But of course you still need to practice to make it fluent enough and you need to learn what all the words mean and do. We'll take the first step into that world in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Today, the aim is to revise our learning up till this point and to fine-tune it. In order to do so we will:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sing 	a song since the melody helps pronunciation very much</p></li>
<li><p>Work 	our way through 10 mini dialogues with everyday language</p></li>
<li><p>Return 	to Tikaajaat's introduction and make sure that we now are able to 	repeat everything she said without problems.</p></li></ol>
<h3><b>Nuilersup qilaap</b></h3>
<p>Here are the first and the last stanza of Hans Lynge's beloved poem:</p>

<p>	<i>Nuilersup qilaap seqinersuata akisunnerata</i></p>

<p><i>	uisikkunigit timmiaarannguit ima torlortarai:</i> </p>

<p><i>	Sululinnguuvutit. Qaa qangattarsarit!</i></p>

<p><i>	...</i></p>

<p><i>	Asagamma qujallunga pakkullagit iperassanatit</i></p>

<p><i>	asasannguara ima taagugara: Seqininnguara</i></p>

<p><i>	anoraannguara, aasannguara!</i></p>

<h3>The mini dialogues</h3>
<p>You will use the following sentences for two purposes: First and foremost as material for practising pronunciation but you will also learn the short sentences by heart as the first input to your vocabulary. Do not bother to try to analyse the sentences in this phase. Just learn to use them. We will soon enough spend lots of energy on understanding and analysing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><i>Qanoq 	ateqarpit? Tikamik ateqarpunga.</i> ('What's your name? My name is Tika')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Tiitorusuppit? 	Massakkuunngitsoq</i> ('Would you like tea? Not now.')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Ataasinnguartorusuppit? 	Qujaannarpunga</i> ('Would you like a drink? Thank you all the 	same')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Qanga 	tikippit? Ippassaq</i> ('When did you arrive? Yesterday')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Qaqugu 	aallaqqissavit? Aqaguagu</i> ('When do you leave again? The day 	after tomorrow')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Utoqqatserpunga!
Ajunngilaq</i> ('I'm sorry! It's OK')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Qanoq 	ippit? Ajunngilanga</i> ('How are you? I'm fine')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Per 	takuiuk? Aap, pisiniarfimmi naapippara</i> ('Have you seen Per? Yes, 	I met him in the shop')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Neriartorniarit!
Piffissaqanngilanga</i> ('Come and eat! I haven't got time')</p></li>
<li><p><i>Pikkoreqaatit!
Qujanaq</i> ('You're good! Thank you')</p></li></ol>
<h3><b>Tikaajaat's welcome</b></h3>
<p>The task to follow is far from an easy one but if you keep focused and give it the effort needed you will be able to meet the demands.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Listen 	closely to Tikaajaats welcome again and write down her words on 	paper.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are happy with your 	achievement check it with the key that is included on the DVD and in 	the booklet. If you have less than a few dozens of spelling mistakes 	you have the right to be very proud of yourself!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Leave 	the key open and keep on listening till all your mistakes are 	corrected.</p></li>
<li><p>Read 	the text aloud a few times while you make an effort not only to 	utter the sounds but also an effort to read in agreement with the 	tonal patterns you just learned.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, 	return to Tikaajaat on the DVD and repeat her welcome word by word 	or a few words at the time. Make sure that you know where to find 	the pause-button.</p></li></ol>
